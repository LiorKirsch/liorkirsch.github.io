Lets say that we are in the movies recommandation business and instead of just providing yes and no recommendation we want to provide a 5 values scoring system: 
[“don’t bother”, “bad but watchable”, “nice”, “very nice”, “Shawshank Redemption” ].
We have this ordering in mind that movies that are “nice” are better than “don’t bother” but are worse than “very nice” and also from “Shawshank Redemption” which has a category all of its own. 

These can also be treated as five ranks: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] but the point is that if a movie get a 2 and another movie gets a 4 it does not mean that the movie is twice as better or that it is +2 better. It means that all the movies in rank 2 are better than those in categories 1 and 0 and are worse than the movies in 3 and 4.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
